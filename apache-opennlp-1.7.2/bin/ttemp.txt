Submissions with the most up-votes appear on the front page or the top of a category. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". Subreddit topics include news, science, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, image-sharing, and many others. The site prohibits harassment, and moderation requires substantial resources. As of <START:date> 2017, <END> Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking #4 most visited web-site in US and #14 in the world.

Their investment saw the company valued at $500 million. Description Site The site is a collection of entries submitted by its registered users, essentially a bulletin board system. The name "Reddit" is a play-on-words with the phrase "read it", i.e., "I read it on Reddit." The site's content is divided into numerous categories, and 49 such categories, or "default subreddits", are visible on the front page to new users and those who browse the site without logging into an account. , these include: {| class="wikitable" |- ! <START:person> Category Subreddits <END> |- Educational News, Science, Space, DataIsBeautiful, TodayILearned, WorldNews - |Entertainment Creepy, Documentaries, Gaming, ListenToThis, Movies, Music, |NoSleep, Sports, Television, Videos - Discussion-based AskReddit, AskScience, |Books, ExplainLikeImFive, History, IAmA, TwoXChromosomes - Humor/light-hearted |Funny, InternetIsBeautiful, Jokes, NotTheOnion, ShowerThoughts, TIFU, |UpliftingNews - Image sharing Art, Aww, EarthPorn, Gifs, MildlyInteresting, |OldSchoolCool, PhotoshopBattles, Pics - Self-improvement DIY, Food, |GetMotivated, LifeProTips, PersonalFinance, Philosophy, WritingPrompts - |Technology Futurology, Gadgets - Meta Announcements, Blog } * Note: There are over 11,400 active subreddits"Active" is defined as [http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1fvovq/browse_the_future_of_reddit_rei- ntroducing/cae97qu?context=1 "subreddits that had at least 5 posts or comments in the past day"], according to /u/chromakode who [http://www.reddit.com/about/team is an admin] with a default set of 50 subreddits . When items (links or text posts) are submitted to a subreddit, the users, called "redditors",[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/redditor Redditor - definition of Redditor] Oxford Dictionaries Online can vote for or against them (upvote/downvote). Each subreddit has a front page that shows newer submissions that have been rated highly. Redditors can also post comments about the submission, and respond back and forth in a conversation-tree of comments; the comments themselves can also be upvoted and downvoted. The front page of the site itself shows a combination of the highest-rated posts out of all the subreddits a user is subscribed to. Front-page rank&nbsp;– for both the general front page and for individual subreddits&nbsp;– is determined by the age of the submission, positive ("upvoted") to negative ("downvoted") feedback ratio and the total vote- count. Dozens of submissions cycle through these front pages daily. The site's logo and its mascot is a line drawing of an alien nicknamed "Snoo". Subreddits often use themed variants of Snoo relevant to the subject. Although most of the site functions like a bulletin board or message board, each subreddit has the option of having an associated wiki that can provide supplementary material like instructions, recommended reading, or collaboration for real-life events. Users Registering an account with Reddit is free and does not require an email address to complete. As of <START:date> June 2015, <END> there were 36 million user accounts.[http://www.redditblog.com/2015/06/happy-10th-birthday-to-us- celebrating.html Happy 10th birthday to us celebrating] Reddit When logged in, Reddit users (known as redditors) have the ability to vote on submissions and comments to increase or decrease their visibility and submit links and comments. Users can also create their own subreddit on a topic of their choosing, and interested users can add it to their frontpage by subscribing to it. For example, , the Wikipedia subreddit&nbsp;– subtitled "the most interesting pages on Wikipedia"&nbsp;– has over 151,000 subscribers. Reddit comments and submissions are occasionally abbreviated and peppered with terms that are understood within (and in many cases also outside) the Reddit community, ranging from OP (for "original poster"&nbsp;– the user who posted the submission being commented upon) to NSFW (for "not safe for work"&nbsp;– indicating the post has graphic or sexually explicit content). Users earn "post karma" and "comment karma" for submitting text posts, link posts, and comments, which accumulate as point values on their user profile. "Post karma" refers to karma points received from text and link posts, while "comment karma" refers to karma points received from comments. Users may also be gifted "Reddit gold" if another user has well received the comment or post, generally due to humorous or high-quality content; this process is known as "gilding." Reddit has also created a system of points called "creddits". Reddit gold "creddits" are like gift certificates: each creddit you have allows you to give one month of Reddit gold to someone else. The points do not lead to a prize as they are meant to stand in as a badge of honor for the user among their peers, although redditors have attempted to redeem their points before. Reddit also allows submissions that do not link externally. These are called "self posts" or "text submissions". Many discussion-based subreddits allow only text-only submissions such as "AskReddit"&nbsp;– where users are only allowed to pose broad, discussion based questions to the community at large. Self posts previously did not accumulate karma points for the submitter, but as of July, <START:date> 2016, <END> these text-only posts generate karma. logo used on <START:date> November 27, 2007]] <END> Reddit communities occasionally coordinate Reddit- external projects such as skewing polls on other websites, such as in <START:date> 2007 <END> when Greenpeace allowed web users to decide the name of a humpback whale it was tracking. Reddit users voted en masse to name the whale "Mr. Splashy Pants", and Reddit administrators further encouraged this by changing the site logo to a whale during the voting. In December of that year, Mister Splashy Pants was announced as the winner of the competition. Within the site, redditors commemorate their "cake day" once a year, which is the anniversary of the day the user's account was first created. The "cake day" offers no special benefit, except that a small icon representing a slice of cake appears next to that user's name for 24 hours. Redditors can "friend" one another, which gives a redditor quick access to posting and comments of their friend list. The commenting system and friend system, along with a certain "Reddit ethos" (called reddiquette on Reddit), lend Reddit aspects of a social networking service, though not to the extent of <START:location> Facebook, <END> Google+, and other websites aimed at providing social networking services. The Reddit community also socializes at meetups held at local parks and bars around the world, and many localized subreddits for local in-person meetings exist. Subreddits Reddit entries are organized into areas of interest called "subreddits". Originally, the front page was the "main-reddit", and other areas were "subreddits". There is now no longer a single main-reddit. Instead, there are now 50 "default subreddits" dealing with topics such as books, television, and music, and thousands of additional non-default subreddits. The default subreddits are the 50 subreddits which are first recommended to new users to select from to appear on, or via their customizable top menu bars. All new users are initially automatically "subscribed to" the 50 default subreddits, but can then customize their "subscriptions." Any registered user who has maintained an account for 31 days or more may create a non-default subreddit. There are over 11,400 active total subreddits to peruse,[http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit- stats/ By the Numbers: 60+ Amazing Reddit Statistics] expandedramblings.com, Digital Tracking Blog, downloaded 10/23/2016. including the default set of 50 subreddits . The site has a default "Front Page" which contains staff selected popular articles, and also an "All Page" which contains only the very top ranked article/ subreddits as ranked by readers themselves, and which page is accessible via an "All" link at the top of the "Front Page." In an interview with Memeburn, Reddit GM, <START:person> Martin <END> noted that the platform's "approach is to give the community moderators or curators as much control as possible so that they can shape and cultivate the type of communities they want". = IAmA and AMA= One of the most popular subreddits is IAmA ("I Am A") where a user may post "AMAs" (for "Ask Me Anything"), or similarly "AMAAs" (for "Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything")&nbsp;– prompts for others to ask questions about any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, and use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; it is similar to a press conference but online.

In contrast, in <START:date> 2012 <END> rapper Snoop Dogg attracted 1.6 million page views after conducting an AMA that provided several candid responses to the community's questions.

For example, the University of Reddit, a subreddit that exists to communally teach, emerged from the ability to enter and leave the online forum, the "classroom", at will, and classes ranging from computer science to music, to fine art theory exist. The unique possibilities that subreddits provide create new opportunities for raising attention and fostering discussion across many areas. In gaining popularity in terms of unique users per day, Reddit has been a platform for many to raise publicity for a number of causes. And with that increased ability to garner attention and a large audience, users can use one of the largest communities on the Internet for new, revolutionary, and influential purposes. Its popularity has enabled users to take unprecedented advantage of such a large community. Its innovative socially ranked rating and sorting system drives a method that is useful for fulfilling certain goals of viewership or simply finding answers to interesting questions. User sentiments about the website's function and structure include feelings about the breadth and depth of the discussions on Reddit and how the site makes it easy to discover new and interesting items. Almost all of the user reviews on Alexa.com, which rates Reddit's monthly unique traffic rating 125th in the United States, mention Reddit's "good content" as a likable quality. However, others raise the negative aspects of the potential for Reddit's communities to possess a "hive mind" of sorts, embodying some negative aspects of group interaction theories like crowd psychology and collective consciousness.

It <END> has also been used for self- organizing sociopolitical activism such as protests, communication with politicians and active communities. <START:person> Reddit <END> has become a prime location for people worldwide to openly discuss politics. = <START:date> March <END> for Science= The March for Science originated from a discussion on reddit that informed about all references to climate change having been deleted from the White House website about which a user commented that "There needs to be a Scientists' March on Washington". = Internet privacy, neutrality and anonymity= Many reddit users are highly engaged in the defense of Internet privacy, net neutrality and Internet anonymity. In advance of legislations that endanger these redditors typically set up pages to organize protest, create and curate content (e.g. media), call responsible authorities and inform about their issues and e.g. relevant tools and organizations. On <START:date> January 11, 2012, <END> Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12- hour sitewide blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act. The blackout occurred on <START:date> January 18 <END> and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In <START:date> May 2012, <END> Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests. = Cannabis legalization= A majority of the site's users seems to support legalization of marijuana. The subreddit dedicated to cannabis culture /r/trees is most active in this regard and often organizes, coordinates or supports drug reform campaigns. In <START:date> 2010, <END> the site ran ads promoting marijuana legalization without charge after <START:person> Conde Nast <END> stated that they do not want to benefit financially from this particular issue. = Reddit's model= Reddit's model could be seen as to having sociopolitical aspects. It is built upon crowdsourcing, user generated content, sharing, altruism, gamification, social reputation and social relevance (opposed to monetary return), participation, freedom of speech, openness, participatory and/or self-governance, new forms of interaction (e.g. #IAmA and AMA) and collective intelligence. Commercial activity In <START:date> February 2013, <END> Betabeat published a post that recognized the influx of multi-national corporations like Costco, Taco Bell, Subaru, and McDonald's posting branded content on Reddit that was made to appear as if it was original content from legitimate Reddit users. Reddit's former Director of Communications noted that while a large number of Chief Marketing Officers want to "infiltrate the reddit community on behalf of their brand," she emphasized that "self-promotion is frowned upon" and the site is "100 percent organic." She recommended that advertisers design promotions that "spark conversations and feedback." She recommended that businesses use AMAs to get attention for public figures but cautioned "It is important to approach AMAs carefully and be aware that this may not be a fit for every project or client." Nissan ran a successful Branded content promotion offering users free gifts to publicize a new car, though the company was later ridiculed for suspected astroturfing when the CEO only answered puff piece questions on the site. <START:person> Taylor <END> described these situations as "high risk" noting "We try hard to educate people that they have to treat questions that may seem irreverent or out of left field the same as they would questions about the specific project they are promoting." Reddit's users are more privacy-conscious than on other websites, using tools like AdBlock and proxies, and they hate "feeling manipulated by brands" but respond well to "content that begs for intelligent viewers and participants." Lauren Orsini writes in ReadWrite that "Reddit's huge community is the perfect hype machine for promoting a new movie, a product release, or a lagging political campaign" but "very specific set of etiquette. Redditors don't want to advertise for you, they want to talk to you." Journalists have used the site as a basis for stories, though they are advised by the site's policies to respect that "reddit's communities belong to their members" and to seek proper attribution for people's contributions. Reddit announced that they would begin using VigLink to redirect affiliate links in <START:date> June 2016. <END> Reddit effect Also known as the "Slashdot effect", the Reddit effect occurs when a smaller website has a high influx of traffic after being linked to on Reddit. It is also called the "Reddit Hug of Death" among the website's users. Because Reddit is such a large site, the traffic is immense and can easily crash smaller sites. In order for users to see crashed websites, several Reddit bots have been created that take a snapshot of the website before large amounts of traffic flood the affected website. "Restoring Truthiness" campaign As a response to <START:person> Glenn Beck's <END> <START:date> August 28, 2010, <END> Restoring Honor rally (heavily promoted by him in his Fox News broadcasts during the summer), in <START:date> September <END> <START:date> 2010 <END> Reddit users started a movement to persuade satirist <START:person> Stephen Colbert <END> to have a counter-rally in Washington, D.C. The movement, which came to be called "Restoring Truthiness", was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he described waking up from a dream in which <START:person> Stephen Colbert <END> was holding a satirical rally in D.C. He writes, "This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like <START:location> San Francisco <END> in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any acid." The idea resonated with the Reddit community, which launched a campaign to bring the event to life. Over $600,000 was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert. The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was held in Washington, D.C. on <START:date> October 30, <END> <START:date> 2010, <END> thousands of redditors made the journey. During a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Ohanian asked, "What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?" <START:person> Jon Stewart <END> responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, the two had already thought of the idea prior and the deposit on using the National Mall was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a "validation of what we were thinking about attempting".[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert- hold-post-rally-to-restore-sanity-press-conference/ Rally to Restore Sanity – Press Conference – Video] Mediaite. <START:date> October 30, <END> <START:date> 2010. <END> In a message to the Reddit community, Colbert later added, "I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout and success." Controversies The website generally lets moderators on individual subreddits make editorial decisions about what content to allow, and has a history of permitting some subreddits dedicated to controversial content. Many of the default pages are highly moderated, with the "science" subreddit banning climate change denialism, and the "news" subreddit banning opinion pieces and columns. Reddit has changed its site-wide editorial policies several times, sometimes in reaction to controversies. Reddit has had a history of giving a platform to objectionable but legal content, and in <START:date> 2011, <END> news media covered the way that jailbait was being shared on the site before the site changed their policies to explicitly ban "suggestive or sexual content featuring minors". Following some controversial incidents of Internet vigilantism, Reddit introduced a strict rule against the publication of non- public personally-identifying information via the site (colloquially known as doxxing). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule. = <START:date> 2010= <END> On <START:date> December 16, 2010, a <END> redditor named <START:person> Matt <END> posted a link describing how he has donated a kidney, and included a JustGive link to encourage users to give donations to the American Cancer Society. After an initially positive reaction, Reddit users began to become suspicious of Matt's intentions, and suggested that he was keeping the donations for himself. Users telephoned his home and he received death threats. <START:person> Matt <END> eventually proved that he was genuine by uploading his doctor's records. = 2011= On <START:date> October 18, <END> <START:date> 2011, <END> an IT manager submitted a post to the subreddit "gameswap" offering Redditors to trade one of 312 codes he had been given for the game [[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]. A group of users obtained his personal details, and began to blackmail him for the codes. The <START:date> Monday <END> after uploading the post, he received 138 threatening phone calls both at home and at his job, and by the end of the day he had been fired. = 2013= Following the <START:date> 2013 <END> <START:location> Boston Marathon <END> bombings, Reddit faced criticism after users wrongly identified a number of people as suspects. Notable among misidentified bombing suspects was Sunil Tripathi, a student reported missing before the bombings took place. A body reported to be Sunil's was found in <START:location> Providence River <END> in <START:location> Rhode Island <END> on <START:date> April 25, 2013, <END> according to Rhode Island Health Department. The cause of death was not immediately known, but authorities said they did not suspect foul play. <START:person> The <END> family later confirmed Tripathi's death was a result of suicide. Reddit general manager <START:person> Martin <END> later issued an apology for this behavior, criticizing the "online witch hunts and dangerous speculation" that took place on the website. The incident was later referenced in the season 5 episode of the CBS TV series [[The Good Wife]] titled "Whack-a-Mole," as well as [[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]. In <START:date> late October 2013, <END> the moderators of the "politics" subreddit banned a large group of websites. Many were left wing opinion websites, such as [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]], [[The Huffington Post]], [[Salon (website)|Salon]], [[Alternet]], [[Rawstory]], [[The <START:person> Daily Kos]], <END> [[Truthout]], [[Media Matters]], and [[ThinkProgress]] as well as some popular progressive blog sites, such as [[Democratic Underground]] and [[Crooks and Liars]]. They also banned a number of right wing sites—[[Drudge Report]], [[Breitbart (website)|Breitbart]], [[The Daily Caller]], Dailypaul, [[Power Line]], and [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]. Salon reported that "the section's moderators explained in a post on Tuesday, the goal is 'to reduce the number of blogspam submissions and sensationalist titles.' The purge, the moderators explained, is also aimed at sites that provide lots of "bad journalism." The December <START:date> 2013 <END> list of banned websites has been modified <START:date> since late <END> October, and sites with original content, such as Mother Jones and The Huffington Post, are allowed. Moderators also banned RT, which moderators stated was due to vote manipulation and spam, though one moderator stated that he wanted RT banned because it is Kremlin backed. = 2014= In <START:date> August 2014, <END> photos from the <START:date> 2014 <END> celebrity photo hack were widely disseminated across the site. A dedicated subreddit, "TheFappening," was created for this purpose, and contained links to most if not all of the criminally obtained explicit images. Some images of Liz Lee and McKayla Maroney from the leak were identified by redditors and outside commentators as child pornography because the photos were taken when the women were underage. The subreddit was banned on <START:date> September <END> 6. The scandal led to wider criticisms concerning the website's administration from [[The Verge]] and The Daily Dot. Also in <START:date> August 2014, <END> moderators and administrators censored a sizeable amount of content related to the GamerGate controversy; one thread in the "gaming" subreddit had almost 24,000 comments removed. Multiple subreddits were deleted by administrators for voicing opinions on Zoe Quinn, <START:person> Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu <END> and similarly important GamerGate controversy figures. The subreddit "ZoeQuinnDiscussion" was banned for violating the Reddit rules. Administrators defended this response when questioned, blaming 4chan for raiding threads and causing harm. This was debated by some redditors. An anonymous subreddit moderator claims he was removed for leaking correspondence between himself and Zoe Quinn. On <START:date> December 18, 2014, <END> Reddit took the unusual step of banning a subreddit, "SonyGOP," that was being used to distribute hacked Sony files. = 2015= After <START:person> Ellen Pao <END> became CEO, she was initially a target of criticism by users who objected to her lawsuit. Later on <START:date> June 10, 2015, <END> Reddit shut down the 150,000-subscriber "fatpeoplehate" subreddit and four others citing issues related to harassment. This move was seen as very controversial; some commenters said that the bans went too far, while others said that the bans did not go far enough. One of the latter complaints concerned a subreddit that was "expressing support" for the perpetrator of the <START:location> Charleston <END> church shooting. Responding to the accusations of "skewed enforcement", Reddit reaffirmed their commitment to free expression and stated that "There are some subreddits with very little viewership that get highlighted repeatedly for their content, but those are a tiny fraction of the content on the site." On <START:date> July <END> 2, <START:date> 2015, <END> Reddit began experiencing a series of blackouts as moderators set popular subreddit communities to private, in an event dubbed "AMAgeddon," a portmanteau of AMA ("ask me anything") and Armageddon. This was done in protest of the recent firing of <START:location> Victoria <END> Taylor, an administrator who helped organize citizen-led interviews with famous people on the popular "Ask me Anything" subreddit. Organizers of the blackout also expressed resentment about the recent severance of the communication between <START:location> Reddit <END> and the moderators of subreddits. The blackout intensified on <START:date> July 3 <END> when former community manager <START:person> David Croach <END> gave an AMA about being fired. Before deleting his posts, he stated that <START:person> Ellen Pao <END> dismissed him with one year of health coverage when he had cancer and did not recover quickly enough. Following this, a Change.org petition to remove Pao as CEO of Reddit Inc. reached over 200,000 signatures. Pao posted a response on <START:date> July 3 <END> as well as an extended version of it on <START:date> July 6 <END> in which she apologized for bad communication and not delivering on promises. She also apologized on behalf of the other administrators and noted that problems already existed over the <START:date> past several <END> years.[http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/06/technology/reddit-back-online- ellen-pao/index.html Reddit CEO <START:person> Ellen Pao <END> apologizes: 'We screwed up'] By Laurie Segall and <START:person> Chris Isidore CNN.com July <END> 6, 2015[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/07/06/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao- issues-apology-for-direction-site/ Reddit CEO <START:person> Ellen Pao <END> Issues an Apology for the Direction of the Site] by <START:person> Laura Entis FoxNews.com July <END> 6, <START:date> 2015 <END> On <START:date> July 10, <END> Pao resigned as CEO and was replaced by former CEO and co-founder <START:person> Steve Huffman. <END> In <START:date> August 2015, <END> Steve Huffman introduced a policy which led to the banning of several offensive and sexual communities. Included in the ban was lolicon which Huffman referred to as "animated CP". Some subreddits had also been quarantined due to having "highly-offensive or upsetting content", such as /r/European, /r/swedenyes, /r/drawpeople, /r/kiketown, /r/blackfathers, /r/greatapes, and /r/whitesarecriminals. = 2016= In <START:date> May 2016, <END> Reddit CEO <START:person> Steve Huffman <END> said on an interview at the TNW Conference that, unlike Facebook, which "only knows what [its users are] willing to declare publicly", Reddit knows its users' "dark secrets" at the same time that the website's "values" page was updated in regards to its "privacy" section. The video reached the top of the website's main feed. Shortly thereafter, announcements concerning new advertisement content drew criticism on the website. In <START:date> September 2016, <END> a Redditor named mormondocuments released thousands of administrative documents belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an action driven by the ex-Mormon and atheist communities of that site. Previously, on <START:date> April 22 of <END> that year, the same Redditor had announced his plans to do so. Church officials commented that the documents did not contain anything confidential. On <START:date> November 23, 2016, <END> Steve Huffman admitted to modifying the contents of many public user comments on Reddit that he disliked. He did so by changing insulting comments made towards him and made it appear as if the insult were directed at the moderators of the "The_Donald" community. On <START:date> November 24, 2016, <END> the Washington Post reported Reddit had banned the "Pizzagate" conspiracy board from their site stating it violated their policy of posting personal information of others, triggering a wave of criticism from users on "r/The_Donald", a popular pro-Trump subreddit, who felt the ban amounted to censorship. The Reddit forum "Pizzagate" was devoted to a conspiracy theory derived from the John Podesta leaked emails, a theory that alleged the D.C. Pizzeria Comet Ping Pong "is at the center of a child-abuse ring tied to <START:person> John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s <END> former campaign manager". After the forum was banned from Reddit, the wording "We don't want witchhunts on our site" now appears on the former page of the Pizzagate subreddit. On <START:date> November 30, 2016 <END> CEO <START:person> Steve Huffman <END> announced changes to the algorithm of their /r/all page to block 'stickied' posts from /r/The_Donald, one of their forums for supporters of Donald Trump. In the announcement, the CEO also apologized for personally editing posts by users from /r/The_Donald, and declared intentions to take actions against "hundreds of the most toxic users" of Reddit and "communities whose users continually cross the line". = 2017= In <START:date> February 2017, <END> Reddit banned the altright forum for violating its terms of service, more specifically for attempting to share personal information about the man who attacked alt-right figure <START:person> Richard <END> B. Spencer. The forum's users and moderators accused Reddit administrators of having political motivations for the ban. Other Imgur is an online image sharing community and image host started in <START:date> 2009 <END> that was designed to be a gift to the online community of Reddit, that jumped from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views in the first five months.
