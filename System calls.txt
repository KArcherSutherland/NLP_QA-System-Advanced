There are two ways to do a system call for this in perl. 

The first: 

#!/usr/bin/perl
my $text = shift; 
my $perl     = $^X;
my $output = `opennlp TokenizerME en-token.bin < $text`;
#print "OUTPUT: \n";
print "$output\n";

The second: 

#!/usr/bin/perl
my $text = shift; 
system "opennlp TokenizerME en-token.bin < $text > output";
open(FILE, "output") || die "Could not open output\n";
while(<FILE>) { 
   chomp; 
   print "$_\n";
}


For each of these, the model (en-token.bin) needs to be in the same directory that you are running this program. 

The opennlp location itself will be in the PATH variable, so when you are running opennlp it will look there and find it. It will not know where the en-token.bin (or other model files) are so those need to be in the same directory.
