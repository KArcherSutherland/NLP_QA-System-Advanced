Question : Who was Reddit invented by?
Answer : Reddit was invented by Steve Huffman.
Actual Text : Reddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates <START:person> Steve Huffman <END> and Alexis Ohanian in <START:date> 2005.

The program searches wikipedia for 'Reddit invented by', then for 'Reddit invented', then just for 'Reddit'.
It then parses the article for Reddit for the word 'invented', then for the word 'by' and returns the highest up sentence that contains a person's name.
Then it pulls out that name and returns it into a reformulated sentence.
Even though the term "invented" never appears in the text, it still returns the right answer because the word 'by' is located at the top of the article with the founders' names.
Because a lot of words were trimmed from the query and not many were kept, the confidence is low, at .32.
